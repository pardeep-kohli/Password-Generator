# 🔐 React Native Password Generator App

Welcome! This is a **React Native Password Generator App** that I built using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).  
It allows users to generate secure and customizable passwords with ease.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

> ⚠️ Make sure you've set up your environment correctly by following the official [React Native Environment Setup Guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

### 1. Install Dependencies

Clone the repo and install all required dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

### 2. Start the Metro Bundler

Metro is the JavaScript bundler used by React Native. Start it using:

```sh
npm start
```

### 3. Run the App

Open a **new terminal window** in the root directory of the project.

#### ▶️ Android

To run the app on an Android emulator or device:

```sh
npm run android
```

#### 🍏 iOS (for macOS only)

If you're running this on iOS for the first time:

```sh
bundle install
bundle exec pod install
```

Then launch the iOS app:

```sh
npm run ios
```

If everything is set up properly, the app will launch in the emulator or on your connected device.
